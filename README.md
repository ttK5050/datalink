# FSX Datalink

FSX Datalink is an open-source experimental physics-interpretation program for use with a full-motion flight simulator. It works in conjunction with Microsoft Flight Simulator X to provide a realtime output of a platform model.

## Project Status

 **This project is not refined. The physics interpretation and output features are rudimentary and are still being developed.** They were not initially required for *this* student submission version (see Authors). 

If you're interested in joining the project to flesh it out, please contact me.

## Contributing
Suggestions and pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss the change.
